//Sometimes, you may want to use a character that is already used in JavaScript
//In this case, you can use an escape sequence. An escape sequence is a 
// backslash \ followed by a character that tells the JavaScript interpreter to 
//interpret the following character in a special way:

let sentence = 'She said, "Hello!"';
console.log(sentence);                  // Output: She said, "Hello!"

sentence = "She said, \"Hello!\"";
console.log(sentence);                  // Output: She said, "Hello!"

sentence = "She said, \"Hello!\"";      // Output: She said, "Hello!"
       
//1st example uses a single quote to start the string and a single quote to end the string. Since the string contains a single quote, we can use a double quote without escaping it.
//2nd example uses a double quote to start the string and a double quote to end the string. Since the string contains a double quote, we can use a single quote without escaping it.
//3rd example uses a single quote to start the string and a single quote to end the string. Since the string contains a single quote, we use a backslash followed by a double quote to escape it.
